"""
  PURPOSE: find the most common issues each week on EdForum.
  HOW: look for the most common phrases in either:
    -> the title of the post & the post itself
    -> only the title (recommended)

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  Set these values:
    -> FILE_NAME: a json file in the same directory with EdForum data.
    -> START_DATE: the first Monday of Week 1 in the form "dd-mm-yyyy".
    -> TERM: current term.
    -> MAX_RESULTS_PER_WEEK: however many results you want to see each week.
    -> SEARCH_TITLE_ONLY: == True/False (recommendation: set to true)
       -> (True): only searches through the post's titles
                  Suggested values: MAX_PHRASE_LEN == 5, MIN_REPEAT == 2
       -> (False): searches through titles and text
                  Suggested values: MAX_PHRASE_LEN == 4, MIN_REPEAT == 3
